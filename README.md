<h2 align='center'>Welcome to my <b>Projects</b> repository!</h2>
<p>This <b>repository</b> has a portfolio purpose. Here you can find all my projects and also a step-by-step of how to run this in your System.</p>

<h2><b>How to run the projects ?</b></h2>
<ol>
<li> First know that you need to have git installed in your SO, so if you don't have it installed, I really recommend you to go <a href="https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-git-windows">here</a> to install and configurate it.</li>
<li>Once you have the Git in your SO you're going to open your <b><i>terminal</i></b> (Powershell on Windows)</li>
<li>In the terminal, go to a <b>directory</b> that you can use tho clone/download the files (if you don't know a good directory go to the <b>Desktop</b> by using <b><i>cd .\Desktop\</i></b> )</li>
<li>So now you're going to type or paste <b><i> git clone https://github.com/ThiagoSFerraz/Projects.git </i></b></li>
<li>Now that you have the <b>repository</b> in your SO, type <b><i>cd Projects</b></i> in the terminal to go to the directory.</li>
<li>Now to keep the step-by-step you need to have <b style="color: #73AA63">Node.js</b> installed in your SO, so if you don't have it installed download it <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">here</a></li>
<li>Now in your terminal in the Projects directory run the command <b><i>npm install </b></i></li>
</ol>
<h2 align='center' style="color: #00bb76; font-weight: 900">Congratulations !!!</h2>
<p>Now to open the projects read the topic "How it works ?" and go to the categories pages to know how to run each project. </p>
